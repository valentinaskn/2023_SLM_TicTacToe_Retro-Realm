# Context
Embarking on your journey as a new game studio, you're immersing yourselves in the software lifecycle by initiating your first project: designing, developing, testing, and iterating upon a digital rendition of the timeless game, Tic-Tac-Toe. This endeavor not only showcases your team's technical prowess but also underscores your commitment to mastering the intricacies of the software development process.
## User Stories
•	As a player, I want to be able to make a move by choosing an empty square, so that I can place my symbol on the board. <br>
•	As a player, I want to be able to see the current state of the game, so that I can keep track of the moves made by both myself and my opponent. <br>
•	As a player, I want to be notified when the game has ended in a win, loss or draw, so that I can see the result of the game. <br>
•	As a player, I want to be able to start a new game after the current game has ended, so that I can play again. <br>

# Tasks
•	Create a GitHub repository (public)<br>
•	Create a GitHub project and link it to the created repository<br>
•	Transfer the user stories to a new Kanban board in the project<br>
•	Give every user story a unique id<br>
•	Create a new Java Maven project<br>
•	Initialize a new git repository<br>
•	Set the GitHub repository as a remote repository<br>
•	Commit and push your blank Java project to the main branch<br>
•	Protect the main branch (only allow pull requests)<br>
•	Start working on the user stories<br>
•	Create a new feature branch for every user story and name it correctly<br>
•	Merge the branch after completion via pull request<br>
